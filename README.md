Hello! I'm actively trying to fix the issue about the "error fetching products". 
Currently, the database that I made is stored in MySQL but render doesn't connect with it. Meaning I have transfer my data to PostgreSQL but the platform has been giving me TONS of issues. Apologies for any inconvenience I will try to fix it soon.
